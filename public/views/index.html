                                        As part of a UBC software engineering course, a large Canadian engineering consulting firm tasked our six-person team to
                                        design and build a MVP capable of user-based image hosting, image editing and
                                        automatic image classification using computer vision. Admin and regular users
                                        are able to upload batches of images where they then add/edit automatic
                                        classification tags, image metadata and simple image editing. The users are then
                                        able to publish these batches of images to the public system where other users are able to view and download.

                                        Due to the extremely limited feedback and ambiguous initial requirements, a large portion of our research included analyzing existing successful applications with similar funtionalities. 
                                        We started by outlining the main functions of the system to estimate what types of users we would expect as well as their main motivations in the system. This resulted in a series of paper prototypes and whiteboard mockups.
                                        A couple weeks into the project we managed to meet with the sponsors and gain the following information:

We believed using a directory browser and smart search feature in parallel would allow users to easily find desired photos and projects despite the immense number of uploads. Initial mock-ups involved an additional layer of filter by displaying viewed content in a table.

                                                            To accomodate the marketing user needs, we provided uploaders the ability to mark images as "marketing ready" when they beleived the photo was high quality. This would allow marketing users to filter searches to only high quality photos. We also decided to swap our initial table view designs for a grid of large thumbnails.
                                                            This would allow marketing users to get a better preview of the images instead of having to open each table item individually.

The initial uploads would be added to one of the userâ€™s workbenches in which they could make any desired changes before publishing to the public portion of the system. This allowed for a process flow in which users could keep track of their work bench progress and return to it over multiple sessions.

        We decided to use React with Prime React UI for some of the components and Redux for our state management of the front-end. The front-end and back-end both used Node.js/Express.js and Passport.js was used for authentication. We used PostgreSQL for our database management and Google Cloud to store all structured data and images. The automatic image classification was complete with Google Cloud Vision API with a Python layer of logic.

                                                    Users have a submission automatically created upon batch image upload. They may also upload to a specific existing submission. The submissions are divided into unpublished and published, indicating whether or not the user has published the submission to the public system. 
                                                    To aid users in finishing submissions over multiple sessions, images are initially placed under the "in progress" tab. 
                                                    While editing, users indicate whether an image is "Complete" or an image they wish to discard as "Archived".
