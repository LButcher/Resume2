                            As part of a UBC software engineering course, a large Canadian engineering consulting firm tasked our six-person team to design and build a MVP capable of user-based image hosting, image editing and automatic image classification using computer vision.
                            Admin and regular users are able to upload batches of images where they then add/edit automatic classification tags, image metadata and simple image editing. The users are then able to publish these batches of images to the
                            public system where other users are able to view and download.

                            Due to the extremely limited feedback and ambiguous initial requirements, a large portion of our research included analyzing existing successful applications with similar funtionalities. We started by outlining the main functions of the system to estimate
                            what types of users we would expect as well as their main motivations in the system. This resulted in a series of paper prototypes and whiteboard mockups. A couple weeks into the project we managed to meet with the sponsors
                            and gain the following information:

                            In an attempt to solve our first problem we took inspiration from Google Drive. We believed using a directory browser and smart search feature in parallel would allow users to easily find desired photos and projects despite the immense number of uploads.
                            Initial mock-ups involved an additional layer of filter by displaying viewed content in a table.

                        <p>
                            To accomodate the marketing user needs, we provided uploaders the ability to mark images as "marketing ready" when they beleived the photo was high quality. This would allow marketing users to filter searches to only high quality photos. We also decided

                            Due to the large number of uploads, we decided to abstract the system into two major components. The initial uploads would be added to one of the user’s workbenches in which they could make any desired changes before publishing to the public portion of
                            the system. This allowed for a process flow in which users could keep track of their work bench progress and return to it over multiple sessions.

                            As part of the UBC CPSC 344 course, we were tasked with improving the existing desktop Yelp application in a small group of 4 people over the course of 3 months. After conducting initial user studies using surveys and structured interviews we found strong
                            evidence supporting the need to add a comparison tool within the existing Yelp application. Using this information we iteratively improved upon the proposed tool design before presenting our final medium fidelity prototype

                            Our initial user research was to uncover what users struggled with while using the existing Yelp desktop web application. To get as much initial data as possible with our limited number of participants, we decided to use a combination of questionnaires,
                            structured interviews and usage observation as a pilot study.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our initial questionnaires and structured interviews were to discover what users were most likely to use Yelp for, how often they used it and their feelings around the existing application. With our participants we found that the most common usage was
                            finding new restaurants to eat at with a small group of friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using this information, we tasked our next round of participants to find a new restaurant to eat at and asked them to think-aloud while doing so. From this we found that almost every user struggled in some way to compare top restaurant choices. From this
                            pilot study it appeared that narrowing down which restaurant they preferred was the biggest pain point. We observed two methods that users employed to reach their final decision. The first method was opening interesting restaurants
                            in different tabs to reduce final number of compared restaurants. The second method we observed was that some users would simply remember which restaurants they've seen and decide based on the best option in their memory.

                            These observed techniques and the corresponding questionnaires/interviews led us to believe that narrowing down the most attractive results via some comparison method would benefit the experience. None of the participants navigated past the first page
                            of results in the pilot study indicating that the comparison would likely only be used to decide between the top few most attractive results. However, we acknowledged that this may not be externally valid due to the participant's
                            desire to use as little effort as possible in a testing scenario.

                            To investigate the best way to include comparison functionality on Yelp, we split our team into two sub-groups to pursue different approaches. Myself and another teammate went with the assumption that the pilot study results showed that users were happy
                            with the existing Yelp experience up until choosing their top choice. Due to this, we decided we should add a comparison tool on top of the existing application as our initial approach instead of re-creating the entire results
                            flow.

                            In case the existing experience was actually creating the issue of needing a comparison method, we decided the other sub-group would fundamentally change how results were displayed. The initial idea was to display the entirety of the search results as
                            a table to quickly view all the information about the restaurants.

                            We found that users much preferred the approach of adding a comparison tool as an extension to the application instead of redesigning how the result data was displayed. This result was consistent among participants of all levels of Yelp familiarity, including
                            two participants that had not used Yelp before. Most users felt that the amount of information shown in a table view was too overwhelming.

                        <p>
                            The initial findings were that users found the experience of drag and dropping search results into a comparison tool area as very intuitive and non-intrusive as they were able to opt-in to using the comparison tool. In post-task structured interviews,
                            participants answered that the usage of sticky notes as restaurant results made it obvious that an entire result could be moved into the comparison tool. We worried that on a computer the results would not be obviously draggable,
                            even with instructions in the comparison tool. We felt that perhaps adding a dotted line around each result or showing each result as a card would increase the affordance of dragging.

                        <p>
                            In post-task interviews we found that the most important criteria when judging restaurants was the atmosphere, price, distance and rating. This criteria was surprisingly consistent across all of the participants. Participants described their perception
                            of atmosphere being based on the uploaded photographs and descriptions in reviews. We found that among the participants that described atmosphere as a major criteria, it was used more to disqualify potential choices rather
                            than to complete a final comparison. This led us to plan our next prototype with price, distance and rating as default comparison properties as the tool would only compare final choices.

                            We initially planned on creating our medium fidelity prototypes in Axure but realized that it was actually easier to set up a quick web application for the desired functionality. I took the HTML pages and stylesheets on the public facing yelp site and
                            brought in some AngularJS components to create our comparison tool.

                            As we did not wish to implement their APIs for this quick prototype, we simply created a predefined list of results when a user searched using the prototype. For the comparison tool we restricted the features that were compared to price, rating and distance
                            based on the previous studies we conducted. We were specifically focussed on the efficiency and learnability of the new tool. To test this we used a think-aloud observation study and a pre/post-study questionnaire.

                            A common critique found was that users that did use the tool wished to include a larger number of options in the tool as the prototype only included the ability to include two at a time. Overall users were happy with the proposal of a comparison tool
                            and said they would likely use it frequently if it was improved further.

                            This is actually version 2 of my online portfolio. I created the first version a few years ago to showcase my work as a student. To demonstrate my knowledge of web development technologies, I created this online portfolio entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                            Other than Node.js and Express for hosting purposes, I use no other frameworks or libraries. All components have been designed and created by me.

                            My first version was started using a boostrap template. As I was learning AngularJS at the time, I decided to modify the template by adding AngularJS material components. The site went through a number of re-designs as I improved upon my web development
                            skills. The final design was similar to this current site but required the user to open the available projects before navigating to the longer descriptions.

                            It's an autonomous robot designed, coded and built by myself and two other students for the lab component of our UBC COGS 300 class. Being autonomous, it has been coded to complete complex goals with only simple actions coded. No human input required.
                            There were two main events that it was created for, maze completion and a capture the flag tournament against the other robots created by our peers. It was able to escape the maze once placed anywhere within the area and able
                            to complete the maze if placed facing the direction of the path to the end. It was also able complete some capture the flag games against the other teams after some small modifications.

                            Powered by an Arduino Uno board, we created the body of the robot using a combination of traditional Lego pieces and Lego Mindstorm motors. To allow it to percieve the environment, we used a number of ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) to sense the distance
                            to maze walls.

                            Similar to the maze robot, we used an Arduino board combined with Lego pieces. However, we upgraded it by adding a color sensor so that it could sense when it was on top of a flag and a servo motor to actually pick up the flags. As it was a competition
                            against the opposing robot, we added some additional features to potentially disable the opposing robot.
